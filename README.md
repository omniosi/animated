Recreating a print magazine article in html and css for the fun of it. The source is a [SciFiNow](http://www.scifinow.co.uk/) article from the TimeWarp section, page 109 of Issue 95. 

I am really interested in translating print design into online executions using all of the extras that the online world offers. This layout will be responsive to the device it is viewed on and include video and interactivity. 

This is the third of the Digital Print series. The first can be seen here:
